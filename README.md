# ReconForge
ReconForge.sh is automated shell script which can be used for recon. All of the most important and best tools are used with proper methodology to recon target.

Steps to install and use:

» First download both scripts ReconForge.sh and install.sh .
» Give execute permissions to both of the files using command "chmod +x {file.sh}".
» install requirements using " sudo ./install.sh ".
» Run main file using command "./ReconForge.sh".
» Enter the path of the target file which contains in scope wildcard domains, make sure file contains only one domain per line.
» script will run and it will ask you some questions to configure scan according to your choice, answer accordingly and provide file paths for custom wordlist/payloads.
» Now Sit back and relax! It will perform all scans using different tools and  save results in same directory.

Note : Use Amass v3 instead of v4 
it is adviced to run this script in VPS as it will take a lot of time to run scans.

Feel free to change the commands of tools according to your personal preference.
I hope this tool helps you in your next Recon.

Thankyou,
Happy Recon:)
